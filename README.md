Computer Graphics and Visualization

How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
> Proabably the importance of modular code (separate files and separate functions)

What design process did you follow for your project work?
> I thought like a modder by analyzing what was already there and making changes.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
> In the future I can be sure to write my own code in terms of files and functions

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
> The task was broken down into smaller milestones.

How did iteration factor into your development?
> There were several milestones leading up to the final project; these helped me complete one task at a time.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
> First I was working on getting objects to display and by then end I had a textured and lighted scene.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
> I have more experience in C++ now and a wanting to explore openGL further.
